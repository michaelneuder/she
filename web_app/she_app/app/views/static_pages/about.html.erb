          The she web app started off as a college project for 5 students at CU
          Boulder. The app creates a sense of purpose for the users and gives
          them the validation that they need from this cruel society. The now
          multi-billion dollar company servers over 2 billion users with the
          focus of giving meaning and companionship to those who need it the
          most. Thank you.
